# How Do You Know If An Actor Is Acting Well? Thoughts on Viewing Cinema as Art

**Date:** January 2026

### Preliminaries

I am not a movie critic, nor an actress, nor do I really know about the ins and outs of any of the -woods (Bollywood, Mollywood, Kollywood, etc). 

### 
As an avid viewer of most Indian films, I find the constant complaint of nepo babies and their acting a little confusing. I will undeniably admit that children of stars (or even relatives, or those with connections to the film industry) have a much easier time entering the industry. However, there is a constant discussion online about how they don't *deserve* these roles, or they continue to get opportunities even after acting poorly. I have always wondered, how does someone sitting on their couch, often hundreds of miles away from any of these actors, know if they actor is acting well or not? In fact, there are many questions that come to mind:

- How do they know if the actor is acting poorly or exactly as the character demands it? Is it easy to distinguish between disliking an actor and disliking the character they play?
- How do you know what the director asked of the actor? Who had the ultimate vision of the acting? 
- How do you know what the correct interpretation of the script was? Is there even such a 'correct' interpretation or portrayal? 

Most importantly, why does the blame for all of the above fall on the actor? The directors, script writers, costume designers, and other actors play an equal role in building the character. 

The answer is obvious: we as viewers connect with the actor when we watch a movie! For the 2-3 hours that we spend engaging with a movie, we form a connection with the actor's character, be it through a backstory, or character progression, or even background music. 


Cinema is a form of art: a means of expression, inspired from society, and that inspires society. It covers a wide range of stories, emotions, creatives, and more. However, with the ever increasing commodification of cinema (getting lost in box office numbers, exorbitant budgets, etc.), it seems we are losing the subjectivity of art forms. Don't get me wrong: I don't think it's possible *not* to commodify art forms, since artists also need to be paid, and their income comes from selling the product they create. However, I believe that being more aware of this would help people realize that there is no right or wrong in acting, or right or wrong in cinema. Often, we are subject to our preconceived notions about what a character should look like [^1] or behave like, and when an actor fails to adhere to these, we consider their work to be flawed. Assumptions based on a trailer or summary are natural; strict requirements of sellability *(often having more adverse affects on women)* are a result of the capitilistic hold on cinema. 

There are many different types of 'girls next door' in the world. Why would cinema have only one?

 Just like you can skip a song you don't like, you can skip a movie you don't like. 



### Acting Style

Recognizing an actor's acting style is also a necessary part of determining whether their acting (lack thereof) is what makes you dislike a film. I aim to illustrate this with the following analogy.

As you enter an art museum and see different styles of paintings, say, impressionism and realism, you find yourself drawn to one or the other. Even if you look at many paintings and seem to not like any of them, you tend to read the placard next to it so you can have some more context. Even still, if you do not like any of the paintings, you go wait at the exit for everyone you came with to finish. 

If you do not like an actor who uses their hands a lot when talking, their acting is not bad, nor is it incorrect; it's just their acting style. 



### Even I Could Do That!

Sure you could! But can you act like that while handling long shoot days, following a strict diet, perhaps learning a new language, and retaking scenes over and over again? Moreover, one's ability to act as well as an actor does not make that actor any worse at acting. 

### So How Can You Tell Who Is Good?

I frankly don't think there is any good litmus test, although maybe the closest I can come up with is comparing the acting across drastically different settings. If they have the same expressions playing both a soulless vampire in a horror comedy and a bubbly cheerful girl in an advertisement for chocolate, *maybe* you can assume that their range is limited. Then again, you can skip their movie and watch another!
