        <p> I have been fortunate to receive a lot of advice from many different mentors and leaders in my life. In an attempt to pay it forward, I have listed some below. </p>
        <i>Please note that these are my personal opinions and not necessarily the opinions of my mentors or leaders. Please also note that I am not a professional advisor, and these are not professional recommendations. Use your best judgement when reading these.</i>

            <dd>Although seemingly straightforward, this is something that I tend to forget often. As students, we are used to environments in which our learning comes with a sense of completeness, whether that be getting an A on an exam, or finishing all the homework problems. Naturally, we try to extend this outside the classroom, but it fails in 
                situations where gaurdrails are not provided. What's most important (for me, at least) is to be aware of this in a twofold manner. Firstly, this should not limit our desire to pursue or share knowledge in certain feilds. At the time of writing this, I do not know much about Error Correcting Codes, but I am nevertheless attempting to jump into the feild. Secondly, 
                rabbit holes are interesting parts of learning, but there should be some way to know when you have gone too far down a particular rabbit hole. I am not sure how to do this yet, but I believe that as we grow as researchers, we will develop the intuition to know when to stop.
