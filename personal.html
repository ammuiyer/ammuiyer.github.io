            <h1>Personal</h1>
            <p>I strongly dislike baking/cooking with a recipe, because it greatly hurts my ego to be told to measure something. I am quite grateful to be born in the era of nondairy milk.</p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Movies</h2>
        <p>One of my favorite pastimes is watching Indian movies. I watch a TON of them, and I could talk for hours about certain ones. I am always open to recommendations, so reach out! </p>
        <p>I think Malayalam movies are my favorite, probably because I grew up watching them, but also I find the acting and stories excellent. However, I am convinced that I know all the Indian languages, and subtitles exist, so I pretty much watch all languages.</p>
        <p>Instead of Letterboxed or anything seriously involed, everytime I watch a movie, I want to describe it in 5 words and rate it. As a heads up, I do not care if your favorite actor's stunt double did a backflip or for action movies in general. </p>
