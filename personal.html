            <p>I strongly dislike baking/cooking with a recipe, because it greatly hurts my ego to be told to measure something. I am quite grateful to be born in the era of nondairy milk.</p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Movies</h2>
        <p>One of my favorite pastimes is watching Indian movies. I watch a TON of them, and I could talk for hours about certain ones. I am always open to recommendations, so reach out! </p>
        <p>I think Malayalam movies are my favorite, probably because I grew up watching them, but also I find the acting and stories excellent. However, I am convinced that I know all the Indian languages, and subtitles exist, so I pretty much watch all languages.</p>
        <p>Instead of Letterboxed or anything seriously involed, everytime I watch a movie, I want to describe it in a few sentences and rate it. As a heads up, I do not care if your favorite actor's stunt double did a backflip or for action movies in general, and this influences my ratings of course. I also am too much of a scaredy cat to watch horror movies. </p>

        <p>Ratings Scale: 10/10 being the best, 1/10 being the worst. 5/10 is average.</p>
        <ul class="goals-list">
            <li>Ponman. <i>Malayalam</i>. <span class="rating">10/10</span>. This is a fast-paced engaging film about middle-class lives, and is quite thought provoking. I found myself enjoying action scenes when I usually do not, and I think this is one of Basil Joseph's best performances. </li> 
            <li>Kannathil Muthamittal. <i>Tamil</i>. <span class="rating">9.9/10</span>. This is one of my favorite Mani Ratnam x ARR films, and I am continuously amazed by the storytelling, soundtrack, and cinematography. I definitely recommend grabbing tissues. In particular, this movie feels like a poignant reminder of a mother-daughter relationship.</li> 
            <li>Pet Detective. <i>Malayalam</i>. <span class="rating">8.5/10</span>. Another komali movie, perfect for a family entertainer. It was not too long and well paced, but the story was a little predictable. </li> 
            <li>The Girlfriend. <i>Telegu</i>. <span class="rating">9.2/10</span>. The color grading and visuals and costuming was excellent. I think the story was a little dramatic in some places, but I understand why this was necessary to communicate the message in an articulate manner. I really liked the songs as well, and the ending was good.</li> 
        </ul>

        I also have a list of absolute favorites, in no particular order:
        <ul class="goals-list">
            <li>Chocolate. <i>Malayalam</i>. 
            <li>Bangalore Days. <i>Malayalam</i>. 
            <li>Jeans. <i>Tamil</i>. 
            <li>Udta Punjab. <i>Hindi</i>. 
            <li>Maharaja. <i>Tamil</i>. 
            <li>Jigra.<i>Hindi</i> 
            <li>Premalu. <i>Malayalam</i>. 
        </ul>
