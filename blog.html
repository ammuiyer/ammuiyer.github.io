            'acting.md': `# How Do You Know If An Actor Is Acting Well? Thoughts on Viewing Cinema as Art

**Date:** January 2026

### Preliminaries

I am not a movie critic, nor an actress, nor do I really know about the ins and outs of any of the -woods (Bollywood, Mollywood, Kollywood, etc). 

### 
As an avid viewer of most Indian films, I find the constant complaint of nepo babies and their acting a little confusing. I will undeniably admit that children of stars (or even relatives, or those with connections to the film industry) have a much easier time entering the industry. However, there is a constant discussion online about how they don't *deserve* these roles, or they continue to get opportunities even after acting poorly. I have always wondered, how does someone sitting on their couch, often hundreds of miles away from any of these actors, know if they actor is acting well or not? In fact, there are many questions that come to mind:

- How do they know if the actor is acting poorly or exactly as the character demands it? Is it easy to distinguish between disliking an actor and disliking the character they play?
- How do you know what the director asked of the actor? Who had the ultimate vision of the acting? 
- How do you know what the correct interpretation of the script was? Is there even such a 'correct' interpretation or portrayal? 

Most importantly, why does the blame for all of the above fall on the actor? The directors, script writers, costume designers, and other actors play an equal role in building the character. 

The answer is obvious: we as viewers connect with the actor when we watch a movie! For the 2-3 hours that we spend engaging with a movie, we form a connection with the actor's character, be it through a backstory, or character progression, or even background music. 


Cinema is a form of art: a means of expression, inspired from society, and that inspires society. It covers a wide range of stories, emotions, creatives, and more. However, with the ever increasing commodification of cinema (getting lost in box office numbers, exorbitant budgets, etc.), it seems we are losing the subjectivity of art forms. Don't get me wrong: I don't think it's possible *not* to commodify art forms, since artists also need to be paid, and their income comes from selling the product they create. However, I believe that being more aware of this would help people realize that there is no right or wrong in acting, or right or wrong in cinema. Often, we are subject to our preconceived notions about what a character should look like [^1] or behave like, and when an actor fails to adhere to these, we consider their work to be flawed. Assumptions based on a trailer or summary are natural; strict requirements of sellability *(often having more adverse affects on women)* are a result of the capitilistic hold on cinema. 

There are many different types of 'girls next door' in the world. Why would cinema have only one?

 Just like you can skip a song you don't like, you can skip a movie you don't like. 



### Acting Style

Recognizing an actor's acting style is also a necessary part of determining whether their acting (lack thereof) is what makes you dislike a film. I aim to illustrate this with the following analogy.

As you enter an art museum and see different styles of paintings, say, impressionism and realism, you find yourself drawn to one or the other. Even if you look at many paintings and seem to not like any of them, you tend to read the placard next to it so you can have some more context. Even still, if you do not like any of the paintings, you go wait at the exit for everyone you came with to finish. 

If you do not like an actor who uses their hands a lot when talking, their acting is not bad, nor is it incorrect; it's just their acting style. 



### Even I Could Do That!

Sure you could! But can you act like that while handling long shoot days, following a strict diet, perhaps learning a new language, and retaking scenes over and over again? Moreover, one's ability to act as well as an actor does not make that actor any worse at acting. 

### So How Can You Tell Who Is Good?

I frankly don't think there is any good litmus test, although maybe the closest I can come up with is comparing the acting across drastically different settings. If they have the same expressions playing both a soulless vampire in a horror comedy and a bubbly cheerful girl in an advertisement for chocolate, *maybe* you can assume that their range is limited. Then again, you can skip their movie and watch another!

**Date:** December 2025

### Preliminaries

First and foremost, there is a *ton* of advice on the internet. You are probably better off reading through those if you have specific questions you want answered. If however, you have decided to continue, I'd like to emphasize that this is merely my opinion, and it should be taken with plenty of salt. I am not resposible if you do not get into MIT. I am also not responsible if you do get into MIT. 

This advice is certainly **not** about what goes on your graduate applications, or how to optimize your application for best outcomes. For that advice, I have shortlisted a few notable ones below: 

- [Overall Graduate Apps Advice](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/gradschooltalk.pdf)
- [Matt Might's Graduate Admissions Advice](https://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-apply-and-get-in-to-graduate-school-in-science-mathematics-engineering-or-computer-science/)
- [What Faculty Look For in SOPs](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics/graduate-programs/admission-process/what-faculty-members-are-looking-for-in-a-grad-school-application-essay/)
- [Github Repo of Advice About Admissions + Beyond](https://github.com/shaily99/advice)
- [Annotated CS PhD SOP Example](https://eugenielai.github.io/posts/another-annotated-sop.html)
- [SOPs and Personal Statements Blog](https://writeivy.com/)

This blog post is about how to (mostly) survive the dreadful October - December period. It can be described as my 'least resistance' method of getting the applications submitted on time. In full honesty, I did this while playing a sport, UCAing, and balancing the general chaos of undergraduate life. I survived, and so can you!  

### Organization/Optimizations

Staying organized is probably the only way to survive this without enraging yourself, your letter writters, or anyone who is invested in your application journey, but you already know that. What you do not know is that there are methods to do this that do not require being extremely meticulous or diligent! 

There are a couple of one-time costs you must incur in order to semi-smoothly sail the rest of the way. Firstly,  I have made this [Application Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iTsexWrLTvJ5yiAQpXnS8OFv1pug5evAQDFTZORejEQ/edit?usp=sharing) you can copy. There are probably a bunch online if you want it to be more colourful. Fill out the schools, the link to their portals, their due dates, if they have a PS or not.

Next, [request your letters](https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/2021/08/18/how-to-ask-for-a-letter-of-recommendation/). 

Then, fill out your letter writer details. 

For the next few weeks, optimize your life like so:

- When you are bored in class/meeting, research schools and potential PIs and add to your list. This builds up over time, since you are definitely not paying attention in every class/meeting you are in. 
- When you are walking from your place to class, listen to a recording of a talk your potential PI gave. This is much easier than reading through a paper you barely understand. You don't even need the video, just listening will give you a gist of it. 
-  Everytime you come across an interesting paper, add it to a list of some sort. My list was approximately one million open tabs on my laptop; I recommend you find a slightly more organized list. At the end of every week, try to cut down the list to half of what it was by reading abstracts and semi-mindlessly skimming through the paper. 
- Start writing your Statement of Purpose (SOP) on a Google Doc. This makes it easier to share with others, and you can transfer it to Overleaf for beautification when it is done. 
    - Every morning when you brush your teeth, think about why you don't want to go to a school. Though counterintuitive, every time you come up with a possible reason, you will shut it down, and this becomes the reason why you *want* to go to a school. If you forget, put a sticky note on the bathroom mirror. 
    - Try to describe your research succintly to your sibling/friend (someone who doensn't have the necessary technical background). Once you start improving here, you will be able to write it much more easily. I found this useful to extract the 'why does my work matter?' out. 
    - Leave yourself voice notes whenever you get struck with an idea. Simply word vomit; you can clean it up after writing it. 
    - ***Do not, under any circumstances, try to write your SOP after midnight and before 6 am.*** Your best work does not occur without sufficient sleep. Plus, if you have done enough passive thinking, writing it will be a breeze. 

This should be the most exciting part of the process, since you get to be fascinated with research directions, and learning more about a school! **If a school's PIs or their research does not excite you, don't apply. You save yourself $100 and a couple extra hours of sleep.**

Once your SOPs are nearing completion, switch over your optimizations to the following:

- When you are bored in class/meeting, fill in the boring parts of the applications, such as your academic history, application details, demographics, etc. 
- When you are walking from your place to class, listen to a recording of you reading your SOP outloud. Once you finish cringing at your own voice, notice how it sounds when you read it outloud. 
    - Keep in mind that after a certain point, changes to your SOP are doing more harm than good, for both you and the SOP. 
-  Every time you buy coffee or matcha or a fun drink, force yourself to finish the details of one application. It takes 10 minutes in the moment, but this is much better than scrambling the hour before it is due. Now your drink is a reward! Either you end up saving money or submitting your applications, a win-win! 


If you even follow this halfway, I am confident you will not be defeated by Evil Procrastination.



### Asking for Feedback

It is great to ask for feedback on your application! Getting an outside perspective on an essay you probably know by heart allows you to see what you often miss, or assume the reader knows. That being said, consider the differences between the target audience of your SOP and who gives you feedback. Be sure to parse your inputs well, and decide what feedback is useful, and what feedback you can disregard. Plus, there are a bunch of ways to write your application and still have it be perfect. My biggest issue was constantly asking for feedback from others. Not only did this take up both their time and my time waiting, I found that their feedback didn't really change much in the end. Limit yourself to 5 people who can see your SOP. 

Keep in mind that all feedback is well-intended. 

### Grades
It is hard to get excellent grades while doing applications, but all you need to remember is that your applications do not contain your grades from Fall semester. Let this guide you however you want.

What I did is picked what classes were important for my interests/feild and decided to prioritize those. Other classes took the backburner, and I did not get an A in those. In any case, you are going to grad school to do research, not to be a 4.0 student. Although I did have moments where my ego was hurt by not getting A, I made an effort to not care about my grades that much this semester. Experts may say that I was not that successful.....

If you do decide that you want to get straight A's and submit your applications well, try to take less classes. Good luck!


### Find an Outlet

While it is great to be surrounded by people who are going through ~~the horrors of~~ graduate admissions with you, it is also important to be able to have an outlet of some form, where you are not surrounded by trigger words like 'SOP', 'Interview', and 'Acceptance Rate'. (*Being a CS major/senior makes this very hard, as people are chasing internships or full-time roles using the same lingo*). For me, this was waterpolo; the endorphins after excercise was also an excellent plus. Graduate admissions was never a conversation topic at practice, and this helped take my mind off of things. 

Practice was scheduled and attendance mattered, which forced me to attend. It's probably in your best interest to pick up something that you must remain accountable for, since otherwise you will quit when things become hectic. 

Instagrams Reels is not a valid outlet. Try as you may (I did!), you will only descend into madness.  

### Comparing Yourself


Do yourself a favor and block r/gradadmissions[^1]. If you haven't come across this website until now, I am disappointed to have been the one to show it to you. You can block it anyways, since you never used it till now. I use [StayFocused](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?utm_source=item-share-cb) on Chrome, and Apple's Web Content Restrictions for Safari.  


It goes without saying that the admissions process is Not Fun. Essentially, you are marketing yourself to schools by reducing yourself down to your accomplishments and desirable qualities, grades and research abilities. Naturally, this messes with your self-esteem and confidence. Moreover, you tend to reflect with extreme scrutiny on your undergraduate life thus far, wondering what you could have done differently to be more 'competitive'. Couple this with comparing yourself with people you do not know much about, and you are in for a pretty miserable ride. 

Amongst all the admissions talk online, people do not really mention this as a struggle of this process, but I am certain I am not the only one who experienced this. Unfortunately, I do not have a lot of advice on dealing with this besides finding an outlet and blocking yourself from opportunities to compare. I hope this is some validation of your feelings if you are in the same boat :) If you are not, kudos to you! 

### Anticipation of Results

I do not have solid advice on how to survive the subsequent period from Jan - April. All I know is that without a routine, it is easy to spend all your time thinking about whether or not you got in (I spent my whole winter break going insane over this). In any case, perhaps the following helps marginally. 

Try to limit how often you check your email. Contrary to popular belief, 'getting your emails over with' first thing in the morning is *not* a good idea, especially if you do not work in corporate. Allow yourself to check only after midday. I turned off phone notifications for Gmail using Screentime Limits. Sometimes I check on my laptop, but I really try not to. Do not, under any circumstances, check your portals. I promise you no school is notifying you via portal without emailing you first. At first, this is really difficult to do. However, once you build the habit of not checking your email in the morning, it tends to stick.

After a particulary frustrating rejection recently, I felt upset even though I knew I didn't have a shot at the school, and I was wondering why. Contemplating further, I realized that an acceptance is more than an opportunity to pursue higher studies, but also validation in a sense. This is obvious, since the whole application process requires you to market yourself and your attributes as a package deal. When you do not get acceptances, it is natural to wonder if you did anything the right way at all. Somehow, recognizing that I wanted to get accepted by a school only for validation, and not because I really felt a connection to a PI there, helped me get over rejections much faster. 



### ~~Surviving~~ Thriving 

As I reflect on the whole admissions process, it is evident that this itself is a little taste of grad school. SOPS turn into grant applications, time management is still of utmost importance, and comparing yourself to others never ends. However, I am certain that if you survived this, it is merely a step in the journey towards thriving in grad school!
