**Date:** December 2025

### Preliminaries

First and foremost, there is a *ton* of advice on the internet. You are probably better off reading through those if you have specific questions you want answered. If however, you have decided to continue, I'd like to emphasize that this is merely my opinion, and it should be taken with plenty of salt. I am not resposible if you do not get into MIT. I am also not responsible if you do get into MIT. 

This advice is certainly **not** about what goes on your graduate applications, or how to optimize your application for best outcomes. For that advice, I have shortlisted a few notable ones below: 

- [Overall Graduate Apps Advice](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/gradschooltalk.pdf)
- [Matt Might's Graduate Admissions Advice](https://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-apply-and-get-in-to-graduate-school-in-science-mathematics-engineering-or-computer-science/)
- [What Faculty Look For in SOPs](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics/graduate-programs/admission-process/what-faculty-members-are-looking-for-in-a-grad-school-application-essay/)
- [Github Repo of Advice About Admissions + Beyond](https://github.com/shaily99/advice)
- [Annotated CS PhD SOP Example](https://eugenielai.github.io/posts/another-annotated-sop.html)
- [SOPs and Personal Statements Blog](https://writeivy.com/)

This blog post is about how to (mostly) survive the dreadful October - December period. It can be described as my 'least resistance' method of getting the applications submitted on time. In full honesty, I did this while playing a sport, UCAing, and balancing the general chaos of undergraduate life. I survived, and so can you!  

### Organization/Optimizations

Staying organized is probably the only way to survive this without enraging yourself, your letter writters, or anyone who is invested in your application journey, but you already know that. What you do not know is that there are methods to do this that do not require being extremely meticulous or diligent! 

There are a couple of one-time costs you must incur in order to semi-smoothly sail the rest of the way. Firstly,  I have made this [Application Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iTsexWrLTvJ5yiAQpXnS8OFv1pug5evAQDFTZORejEQ/edit?usp=sharing) you can copy. There are probably a bunch online if you want it to be more colourful. Fill out the schools, the link to their portals, their due dates, if they have a PS or not.

Next, [request your letters](https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/2021/08/18/how-to-ask-for-a-letter-of-recommendation/). 

Then, fill out your letter writer details. 

For the next few weeks, optimize your life like so:

- When you are bored in class/meeting, research schools and potential PIs and add to your list. This builds up over time, since you are definitely not paying attention in every class/meeting you are in. 
- When you are walking from your place to class, listen to a recording of a talk your potential PI gave. This is much easier than reading through a paper you barely understand. You don't even need the video, just listening will give you a gist of it. 
-  Everytime you come across an interesting paper, add it to a list of some sort. My list was approximately one million open tabs on my laptop; I recommend you find a slightly more organized list. At the end of every week, try to cut down the list to half of what it was by reading abstracts and semi-mindlessly skimming through the paper. 
- Start writing your Statement of Purpose (SOP) on a Google Doc. This makes it easier to share with others, and you can transfer it to Overleaf for beautification when it is done. 
    - Every morning when you brush your teeth, think about why you don't want to go to a school. Though counterintuitive, every time you come up with a possible reason, you will shut it down, and this becomes the reason why you *want* to go to a school. If you forget, put a sticky note on the bathroom mirror. 
    - Try to describe your research succintly to your sibling/friend (someone who doensn't have the necessary technical background). Once you start improving here, you will be able to write it much more easily. I found this useful to extract the 'why does my work matter?' out. 
    - Leave yourself voice notes whenever you get struck with an idea. Simply word vomit; you can clean it up after writing it. 
    - ***Do not, under any circumstances, try to write your SOP after midnight and before 6 am.*** Your best work does not occur without sufficient sleep. Plus, if you have done enough passive thinking, writing it will be a breeze. 

This should be the most exciting part of the process, since you get to be fascinated with research directions, and learning more about a school! **If a school's PIs or their research does not excite you, don't apply. You save yourself $100 and a couple extra hours of sleep.**

Once your SOPs are nearing completion, switch over your optimizations to the following:

- When you are bored in class/meeting, fill in the boring parts of the applications, such as your academic history, application details, demographics, etc. 
- When you are walking from your place to class, listen to a recording of you reading your SOP outloud. Once you finish cringing at your own voice, notice how it sounds when you read it outloud. 
    - Keep in mind that after a certain point, changes to your SOP are doing more harm than good, for both you and the SOP. 
-  Every time you buy coffee or matcha or a fun drink, force yourself to finish the details of one application. It takes 10 minutes in the moment, but this is much better than scrambling the hour before it is due. Now your drink is a reward! Either you end up saving money or submitting your applications, a win-win! 


If you even follow this halfway, I am confident you will not be defeated by Evil Procrastination.



### Asking for Feedback

It is great to ask for feedback on your application! Getting an outside perspective on an essay you probably know by heart allows you to see what you often miss, or assume the reader knows. That being said, consider the differences between the target audience of your SOP and who gives you feedback. Be sure to parse your inputs well, and decide what feedback is useful, and what feedback you can disregard. Plus, there are a bunch of ways to write your application and still have it be perfect. My biggest issue was constantly asking for feedback from others. Not only did this take up both their time and my time waiting, I found that their feedback didn't really change much in the end. Limit yourself to 5 people who can see your SOP. 

Keep in mind that all feedback is well-intended. 

### Grades
It is hard to get excellent grades while doing applications, but all you need to remember is that your applications do not contain your grades from Fall semester. Let this guide you however you want.

What I did is picked what classes were important for my interests/feild and decided to prioritize those. Other classes took the backburner, and I did not get an A in those. In any case, you are going to grad school to do research, not to be a 4.0 student. Although I did have moments where my ego was hurt by not getting A, I made an effort to not care about my grades that much this semester. Experts may say that I was not that successful.....

If you do decide that you want to get straight A's and submit your applications well, try to take less classes. Good luck!


### Find an Outlet

While it is great to be surrounded by people who are going through ~~the horrors of~~ graduate admissions with you, it is also important to be able to have an outlet of some form, where you are not surrounded by trigger words like 'SOP', 'Interview', and 'Acceptance Rate'. (*Being a CS major/senior makes this very hard, as people are chasing internships or full-time roles using the same lingo*). For me, this was waterpolo; the endorphins after excercise was also an excellent plus. Graduate admissions was never a conversation topic at practice, and this helped take my mind off of things. 

Practice was scheduled and attendance mattered, which forced me to attend. It's probably in your best interest to pick up something that you must remain accountable for, since otherwise you will quit when things become hectic. 

Instagrams Reels is not a valid outlet. Try as you may (I did!), you will only descend into madness.  

### Comparing Yourself


Do yourself a favor and block r/gradadmissions[^1]. If you haven't come across this website until now, I am disappointed to have been the one to show it to you. You can block it anyways, since you never used it till now. I use [StayFocused](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?utm_source=item-share-cb) on Chrome, and Apple's Web Content Restrictions for Safari.  


It goes without saying that the admissions process is Not Fun. Essentially, you are marketing yourself to schools by reducing yourself down to your accomplishments and desirable qualities, grades and research abilities. Naturally, this messes with your self-esteem and confidence. Moreover, you tend to reflect with extreme scrutiny on your undergraduate life thus far, wondering what you could have done differently to be more 'competitive'. Couple this with comparing yourself with people you do not know much about, and you are in for a pretty miserable ride. 

Amongst all the admissions talk online, people do not really mention this as a struggle of this process, but I am certain I am not the only one who experienced this. Unfortunately, I do not have a lot of advice on dealing with this besides finding an outlet and blocking yourself from opportunities to compare. I hope this is some validation of your feelings if you are in the same boat :) If you are not, kudos to you! 


### ~~Surviving~~ Thriving 

As I reflect on the whole admissions process, it is evident that this itself is a little taste of grad school. SOPS turn into grant applications, time management is still of utmost importance, and comparing yourself to others never ends. However, I am certain that if you survived this, it is merely a step in the journey towards thriving in grad school!
